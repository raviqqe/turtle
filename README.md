Clone of [the Ninja build system](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja) written in Rust

## Goals

- Naive but safe (no `unsafe`) reimplementation of the Ninja build system in Rust
- Improved frontend support (WIP)
  - Full output from build rules and no output from Turtle by default
  - More customizable build/rule/progress/error output

Turtle is originally written for [the Pen programming language](https://github.com/pen-lang/pen). Therefore, we support only dynamic dependencies but not C/C++ header dependencies currently. Your contribution is welcome! ðŸ˜„

## Install

```sh
cargo install turtle-build
```

## Usage

```sh
turtle
```

For more information, see `turtle --help`.

## Compatibility

Turtle aims to support full syntax of the Ninja build files. It also supports basic command line arguments but is not going to implement all the original options.

### Syntax

- [x] `build` statement
  - [x] Explicit outputs
  - [x] Explicit inputs
  - [x] Implicit outputs
  - [x] Implicit inputs
  - [x] Order-only inputs
  - [x] `phony` rule
- [x] `rule` statement
- [x] `default` statement
- [x] `include` statement
- [x] `subninja` statement
- [ ] `pool` statement
- [x] Global variables
- [x] Build-local variables
- [x] `in` and `out` special variable

### Command line arguments

- [x] `-f` custom build file option
- [x] `-j` job limit option
- [ ] `-k` keep-going option
- [ ] `-C` change-directory option

### Others

- [x] Circular build dependency detection
